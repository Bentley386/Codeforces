A collection of problems I've solved on codeforces.com

Most of them are sorted by difficulty - the problem "ratings".
The unsorted problems include the ones provided as exercises on educational "topic streams" hosted by Colin Galen on YouTube.

The very first problems are solved in C, while the vast majority is solved in C++. Few problems are solved in Java or Haskell.

Advent of Code 2024 (Thematically fits the repo) was solved with Python.
